# This is my website for any non metal head or metalhead, in general. This is used so you are able 
# to find any type of band you may want to get into or try out.
# Say you wanted to find out what Doom Metal is becasue you heard Black Sabbath is under the category of
# Doom metal. You type in Doom or, of course, other names that may match band like Black Sabbath, 
# a variety of bands will come up that will closely match your liking or description.
# After you have found the band that matches what you want or would like to hear, you can sample their 
# music and then on that page you can find their merch link, find their tour dates, find their biography 
# and once you have done that, hopefully, you will go back and search for more bands and continue on 
# the journey that is metal and everything that it has to offer to you

# This can also be used to try and find out of your comfort zone. Let's say you wanted some heavy 
# Death Metal but you know that they have scary lyrics, scary album covers but wanted something less. 
# Type in things that could potentially relate to what you are searching for, adding in Death metal,
# there are fun genres such as "dummy metal" beacause they're truly just goofy and fun but still keep
# the same vibe as death metal, its just not meant to be taken as "serious" as some can be

# Remember, metal is not subjective, it is fun and it is extremely broad. That is why I chose to do this 
# I want you to go down the path of metal and find what could suit you well and I truly hope you find 
# every bit of metal you can enjoy
